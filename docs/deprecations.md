# Deprecations & Archived Materials

This document tracks deprecated or misaligned documentation and references, kept only for historical context. All items listed here have been backed up under `/backups/<date>/...`.

## Deprecated Docs
- CUSTOMER_MODULE_USAGE.md — replaced by `docs/clients/README.md` and the Clients terminology
- DATABASE_DIAGRAM.md — contains non-domain tables (e.g., PRODUCTS). The canonical schema is now `docs/database/schema.md`.

## Policy
- Do not reference deprecated docs in new work.
- If needed, extract relevant parts and port them into canonical docs in English.
